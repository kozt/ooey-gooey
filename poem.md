# Ooey-Gooey

Ooey-Gooey was a worm.

A [mighty worm](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dhmpZHIi9FQ/Vc5_ZVFcPZI/AAAAAAAATL0/w_2neSsEvoE/s1600/DannyDarkling.jpg) was he.

He sat upon a railway track,

A train he did not see.

The train came roaring round the bend,

The driver gave a squeal,

The guard got out his pocket knife, 

And scraped him off the wheel.

Ooey Gooey!
